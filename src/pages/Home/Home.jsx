        CalculusQuickNotes.com is an ongoing project to bring an Android app
        that I created back in 2016,{" "}
        <CustomLink href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tutorillinois.android.calculusquicknotes">
          Calculus Quick Notes
        </CustomLink>{" "}
        to a web app format.
      </CustomTypography>
      <CustomTypography>
        I had not yet started working as a professional developer when I created
        this app, but it helped me land my first position. After I got my first
        job, I stopped focusing on the app and did not bring any new content.
        Nor did I update it to the latest Android version. At that time, it had
        over 150K downloads with an overall rating of 4.7 from about 700
        reviews.
      </CustomTypography>
      <CustomTypography>
        It has always been in the back of my mind that I would like to port
        Calculus Quick Notes to a web app format, but I have always been too
        busy or too tired or too unmotivated to take steps towards that. I have
        actually met a few people who, when I told them that I had created that
        app, expressed surprise and appreciation, as they themselves had used it
        to help pass calculus.
      </CustomTypography>
      <CustomTypography>
        In January 2023, I decided to leave what was my present position, and
        take a few months off to pursue my interests in data visualization. I
        wanted to refocus my career towards my passions. For a project, I
        decided to return to Calculus Quick Notes, this time adding
        interactivity in many of the places that were previously static
        diagrams. The wording mostly remains the same at the original app, with
        small changes where I second guessed how I presented a concept, but more
        often to accommodate enhanced interactivity. I'm also adding a few new
        pages based on concepts students frequently encounter that weren't
        previously covered. Finally, anyone familiar with my old app will also
        notice the updated palette to the sort of Solarized/Synthwave look.
      </CustomTypography>
      <CustomTypography>
        Besides porting over all of my old content (which is a long, slow
        process), there are other changes that I want to make including putting
        small summary equations directly in the menu, and possibly putting a
        switch in the menu bar that lets the user switch over to a daylight
        theme. Also, I want to ensure full A11y compliance. This is not a
        profit-generating project, but I still think it's a nice thing to do.
      </CustomTypography>
      <CustomTypography>
        Until then, I hope that you enjoy this app as I update it.
