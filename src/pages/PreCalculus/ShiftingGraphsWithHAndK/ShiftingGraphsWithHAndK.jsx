        Explanation
      </Typography>
      <CustomTypography>
        This idea is usually taught in a chapter on conic sections as one of
        many transformations. This is such a useful general principle in
        algebra, and I make sure that all of my students understand it as it's
        own topic. The following examples will demonstrate this principle.

        This change resulted in the output row being shifted to the right by{" "}

        For an analogy, imagine that you are driving a car with a broken
        speedometer that always reports your speed as 10mph <em>slower</em> than
        you are driving. Consequently, relying on the speedometer you will
        always be driving 10mph <em>faster</em> than you intended to drive.
      </CustomTypography>
      <CustomTypography>
        Imagine, so that you won't be late, you set your alarm clock to display
        the time 15 minutes <em>later</em> than the current time. By doing to,
        you will hopefully wake up 15 minutes <em>earlier</em> than you need to
        (some people do things like this).
      </CustomTypography>
      <CustomTypography>
        Similar to the speedometer, which by giving you a value <em>less</em>{" "}
        than the current speed {`$ (x-10) $`} will cause you to drive 10mph{" "}
        <em>more</em> than the current speed, the parabola equation, receiving a
        value of 2 <em>less</em> than the current x value (replacing{" "}
        {`$ {\\color{${sunsetMagenta}} {x}} $`} with{" "}
        {`$ {\\color{${sunsetMagenta}} {(x-2)}} $`}) will give us a graph of a
        parabola shifted <em>to the right</em> by 2.
      </CustomTypography>
      <CustomTypography>
        From the alarm clock analogy, you can probably guess what happens if you
        add a positive {`$ {\\color{${sunsetMagenta}} {h}} $`} to{" "}
        {`$ {\\color{${sunsetMagenta}} {x}} $`} (which would be the same as
        subtracting a negative {`$ {\\color{${sunsetMagenta}} {h}} $`} from{" "}

        Play with the demo below to get an intuitive feeling for shifting a

        An Example with Circles
      </Typography>
      <CustomTypography>
        Write an equation for a circle with a radius {`$2$`} centered at{" "}
        {`$(1,2)$`}.
      </CustomTypography>
      <CustomTypography>
        Rather than look this up in a textbook, let's think about how to write
        an equation for a circle centered at {`$(0,0)$`}, and then use{" "}
        {`$ {\\color{${sunsetMagenta}} {h}} $`} and{" "}
        {`$ {\\color{${sunsetYellow}} {k}} $`} to shift the circle into our
        desired position.
      </CustomTypography>
      <CustomTypography>
        Let's define a circle as{" "}
        <em>
          the set of all points equidistant from a fixed point (the center).
        </em>
      </CustomTypography>
      <CustomTypography>
        If the points are a distance {`$r$`} from the center, than the radius{" "}
        {`$r$`} and the coordinates of the individual points {`$x$`} and {`$y$`}{" "}
        are all related by the equation: {`$r^2 = x^2 + y^2$`}.
      </CustomTypography>
      <HandKCircleGraph />
      <CustomTypography>
        A circle with radius {`$2$`} will have the equation {`$4 = x^2 + y^2$`}{" "}
      </CustomTypography>
      <CustomTypography>
        To shift this circle to the right by {`$1$`}, we have to replace{" "}
        {`$ {\\color{${sunsetMagenta}} {x}} $`} with{" "}
        {`$ {\\color{${sunsetMagenta}} {(x-1)}} $`}. To shift the circle down by{" "}
        {`$2$`}, we have to replace {`$ {\\color{${sunsetYellow}} {y}} $`} with{" "}
        {`$ {\\color{${sunsetYellow}} {(y-(-2)) = (y+2)}} $`}.
      </CustomTypography>
      <HandKCircleGraphShift />
      <CustomTypography>
        You will have to do some algebra to isolate the y and put this equation
        into a form suitable for a graphing calculator.
      </CustomTypography>
      <DisplayEquation>{`$$4=(x-1)^2+(y+2)^2$$`}</DisplayEquation>
      <DisplayEquation>{`$$(y+2)^2 = 4 - (x-1)^2$$`}</DisplayEquation>
      <DisplayEquation>{`$$y+2 = \\pm \\sqrt{4-(x-1)^2} $$`}</DisplayEquation>
      <DisplayEquation>{`$$y =  -2 \\pm \\sqrt{4-(x-1)^2} $$`}</DisplayEquation>
      <CustomTypography>
        Then you will have to enter these as two separate functions, one for the
        positive root and one for the negative root.
